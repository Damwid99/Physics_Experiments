# Gravity Simulator
This is a gravity simulator built using Pygame. It allows users to visualize the gravitational interactions between celestial objects and observe their movements in space.

## Overview
The simulator features:

Simulation of celestial objects like stars, planets, and moons.
* Gravity-based movement calculations.
* User interaction for zooming, pausing, and selecting celestial objects.
* Information display for individual objects.

## How to Use
1. Requirements
    * Python 3
    * Pygame library
2. Setup
    * Install Python if not already installed.
   * Install Pygame by running pip install pygame.
3. Running the Simulator
    * Run python gravity_simulator.py to start the simulator.
    * Use arrow keys to move the camera.
    * Press SPACE to pause/resume simulation.
    * Press 1 or 2 to zoom in/out.
    * Move your cursor on celestial objects to view information about them.
    * Move your cursor on dropdowns to select specific celestial objects.

## Celestial Objects Included
* Sun
* Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus
* Moons: Moon, Phobos, Deimos, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, Europa, Titan, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Titania, Oberon, Umbriel

## File Structure
* gravity_simulator.py: Main Python file containing the simulation logic.
* README.md: Documentation file (you're reading it now).

## Future Improvements
* Implement more physics models.
* Add user controls for adjusting simulation parameters.
